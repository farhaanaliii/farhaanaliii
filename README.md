Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a backend developer passionate about exploring programming, reverse engineering, and cybersecurity. My coding journey started in 8th class, and since then, I’ve worked on building efficient backend systems, with a focus on API development, data processing, and security. I love solving real-world problems and constantly learning new techniques to improve my skills. When I’m not coding, I’m usually gaming—taking on challenges and enjoying some fun competition!
