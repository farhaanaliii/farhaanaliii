Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a backend developer passionate about exploring programming, reverse engineering, and cybersecurity. My coding journey began in 8th grade, and since then, I’ve focused on building efficient backend systems, with a particular emphasis on API development, data processing, and security. I enjoy solving real-world problems and continually learning new techniques to enhance my skills. When I’m not coding, I’m usually gaming—taking on challenges and enjoying some fun competition!
